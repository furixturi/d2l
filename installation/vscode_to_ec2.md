# Use VSCode Desktop to Work with Remote Notebooks and Jupyter Server

I love developing in VSCode, with all my favorite theme, color palette, and extensions conrigured to my liking. 

I run a Jupyter server locally on my little Macbook Air and the VSCode Jupyter extension connects to it nicely. However, it soon became obvious that what I want to do is just too demanding for my local resources (took me one whole minute just to install matplotlib).

So I decide to launch a more powerful EC2 to do the job, while still working with the VSCode on my machine.
